# CHAPI

**CHAPI** (ChaCha20-based Host Address Protocol over UDP) is a minimalist, secure, and efficient protocol to query your public IP address over encrypted UDP using ChaCha20-Poly1305

## Why CHAPI?

Many applications and systems need to know their public IP address ‚Äî yet most solutions rely on full HTTPS stacks (such as nginx combined with curl), requiring heavy TLS handshakes and HTTP headers just to return a tiny string like 1.2.3.4. (Frustrated by this unnecessary overhead, I developed CHAPI.)

**CHAPI** is a lightweight alternative designed for self-hosters, embedded devices, and low-overhead environments. It lets trusted clients query the server over encrypted UDP, returning only what‚Äôs needed ‚Äî your IP

## üöÄ Features & Performance

- **ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption** ‚Äî secure by default, without OpenSSL or TLS bloat  
- **High-performance UDP server** ‚Äî extremely lightweight and fast  
- **Single-threaded design** ‚Äî suitable for embedded or minimal Linux environments  
- **Minimal overhead** ‚Äî no TLS handshakes, no HTTP headers, just encrypted IP delivery
- **One-RTT response** ‚Äî client gets encrypted IP reply in a single round-trip
- **Rate limiting support** ‚Äî prevent abuse with per-IP throttling (optional via macro)  
- **Resilient to attacks** ‚Äî encrypted communication, strict format validation  
- **Low memory usage** ‚Äî chapi-server uses ~1.2 MB RAM on Linux (RSS)
- **Proven fast in benchmarks** ‚Äî with 50 concurrent clients, a total of 1000 encrypted requests took approximately 1.5 seconds

### ‚öôÔ∏è Benchmark Example

```
Total requests: 1000
Concurrency: 50 clients
Successes: 1000
Failures: 0
Total time: 1.5 seconds
Average time per request: 0.0015 seconds (1.5 ms)
```
This demonstrates that even with a single-threaded design on a single-core VPS, CHAPI can achieve this level of performance
This makes it more efficient than HTTP+TLS solutions, especially in bandwidth-sensitive or embedded environments

## Requirements

- GCC compiler (tested with gcc 13.3.0)
- libsodium library installed (for ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption)

---

## Installation

### 1. Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential libsodium-dev
```

### 2. Clone the repository and enter directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/liuyuf78fk/chapi.git
cd chapi
```

### 3. Generate a shared ChaCha20-Poly1305 key

```
./gen_key.sh
```

You will see output like:

```
Generating ChaCha20-Poly1305 shared key (256-bit)...

Please copy the following content into the KEY_HEX macro definition in common.h:

#define KEY_HEX "5b766b1ea5e65ca55d33feac34c5f35da501b019ff85e0ab1be558c11a8e75d3"
```

Open `common.h` and replace the `KEY_HEX` macro with the generated value

### 4. Configure settings in `common.h`

```c
#define SERVER_PORT 10000
#define KEY_HEX "5b766b1ea5e65ca55d33feac34c5f35da501b019ff85e0ab1be558c11a8e75d3"
#define NONCE_LEN crypto_aead_chacha20poly1305_IETF_NPUBBYTES
#define KEY_LEN crypto_aead_chacha20poly1305_IETF_KEYBYTES
#define MAC_LEN crypto_aead_chacha20poly1305_IETF_ABYTES
#define MAX_MSG_LEN 256

#define SERVER_BIND_ADDR   "0.0.0.0"
#define SERVER_PUBLIC_ADDR "127.0.0.1"

//#define ENABLE_RATE_LIMIT
#define RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW 6    // in seconds
#define RATE_LIMIT_COUNT 1
#define MAX_CLIENTS 1024

#define LOG_LEVEL 1            // 0=off, 1=errors only, 2=verbose
```

## Build

```bash
make
```

---

## Installation

### For the server:

```bash
sudo make install
```

This will:

- Create a dedicated system user `chapi` if it does not exist
- Install binaries to `/usr/local/bin/`
- Install and enable the systemd service `chapi-server.service`
- Start the service immediately

### For the client only:

```bash
sudo make install-client
```

This installs only the client binary

---

## Running and Logs

The server runs as a systemd service named `chapi-server.service`

Check server logs with:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u chapi-server.service -f
```

---

## Usage

Run the client (example):

```bash
chapi-client
```

It will query the server and print your public IP or an error
